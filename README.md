Belt Braiding: the process of having multiple types (colors) of belt running under one another in the same axis. To effectively have 2 or more belts using the same game tile.

Details
--------

- When a player directly or via a bot commits belt braiding they shall be punished.
- A punished player may be let off with a warning for the first few offences if tolerated via the mod setting.
- A punished player is purified by fire, preferably until death.
- Any robot which helped commit the belt braiding act is struck down.
- The offending underground belts are consumed in to the earth by the worms lurking deep.
- A message is sent to all players about each offence so they know to shun the offender.

Existing Maps - WARNING
------------

When this mod is applied to an existing save, upon the first underground belt route being placed or removed it will immediately search the map for any braided belts and purge them with fire. No retrospective punishment to any players will be dealt for these.
