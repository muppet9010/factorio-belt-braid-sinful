Bugs:
    - doesn't handle upgrade planner and the upgrade cancel action you can do to to only half the underground

Next:
	- Through using upgrade planner belts can be braided. Guessing by placing the same colour and then upping certain pairs?
    - handle belts marked for decon and undecon as equivilvent to build and non build.
	- Make the worm in the hole a bit more visible with the smoke over it
	- make a map marker message for when it occurs so everyone can see where the offense was (helpful if placed by bots)
	- support warning setting of -1 for infinite warnings, never any punishments
	- option to provide custom messages

Future:
	- option to block crossing belts, not just same line.
	- option to include underground pipes.
